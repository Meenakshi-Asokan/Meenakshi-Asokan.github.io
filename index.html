<p> 
  I am a PhD student in the <a href="https://scholar.harvard.edu/polleylab">Polley Lab</a> 
  at <a href="http://dms.hms.harvard.edu/shbt/">Harvard University</a>. 
  My broad interests span the union of sensory physiology and perception, motivated and social behaviors, and
  circuit-level perspectives on why we perceive the world the way we do! For my PhD, I have studied 
  the transformations in neural coding of sound along the auditory neuro-axis, sensory guided decision making 
  in challenging environments and plasticity in neural circuits within and beyond the auditory system. 
  To this end, I've used anatomical tracing, behavioral approaches, calcium imaging, 
  simultaneous multi-region extracellular electrophysiology, optogenetics, as well as computational techniques for data analysis.

  Before moving to Boston for graduate school, I did my undergraduate studies at Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Madras 
  in India where I majored in Electrical Engineering and minored in Biomedical Engineering. I grew up in Madras, India where we only have three
  seasons - hot, hotter and hottest, so you can imagine how much I appreciate having real seasons in Boston!
  While I mostly study brains, I also ocassionaly fly planes, and my love for nature and adventure never wanes :) I really enjoy the weekends I spend 
  hiking, skiing, rock climbing and doing other things outdoors and adventurous that constantly challenge me to learn something new, 
  become stronger, overcome my fears, and most importantly keep me sane and happy!
