<p> 
  I am currently a postdoctoral fellow in the <a href="https://tyelab.org/">Tye Lab</a> at <a href="https://www.salk.edu/">Salk Institute</a>. 
  I did my PhD thesis in the <a href="https://scholar.harvard.edu/polleylab">Polley Lab</a> 
  at <a href="http://dms.hms.harvard.edu/shbt/">Harvard University</a>.  
  The overarching goal of my thesis research was to investigate how the neural coding across 
  sensory and limbic hierarchies give rise to the transformation from sensation to perception. To achieve this, 
  I used simultaneous multi-regional single-unit recordings, optogenetics and in-vivo calcium and sensor imaging during head-fixed behavior in awake mice as well as 
  several computational approaches for data analysis. For my postdoctoral work, I'm investigating whether <i>multi-brain</i> coupling predicts and causally drives social engagement and pro-sociality. 
  In the long term, I'm interested in how our emotional state and level of social engagement modulates our perception, and 
  I aim to synthesize the rigor and reductionism in sensory neuroscience with the richness and complexity in naturalistic social behaviors!

  Before moving to Boston for graduate school, I did my undergraduate studies at <a href = "https://www.iitm.ac.in/">Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Madras</a> 
  in India where I majored in Electrical Engineering and minored in Biomedical Engineering. I was fascinated by the application 
  of computational tools borrowed from math and engineering to understand the brain and did my undergraduate thesis 
  in Dr. Srinivasa Chakravarthy's <a href = "https://biotech.iitm.ac.in/Faculty/CNS_LAB/home.html"> computational neuroscience lab</a> at the institute. I also obtained a fellowship to 
  pursue an undergraduate research internship at Technical University of Munich, Germany where I worked in <a href = "https://www.professoren.tum.de/en/hemmert-werner">Dr. Werner Hemmert's</a> 
  computational auditory neuroscience lab.

  Growing up in a middle class Indian society where I was repeatedly told I canâ€™t achieve a lot of things that men do, 
  I became very passionate about proving it wrong. That drove me to go to IIT Madras, one of the most coveted engineering colleges in India 
  for which ~5000 students get selected from ~500,000 students who give a competitive entrance exam each year. Being a woman in that top 1% during my time meant 
  spending the next four years in a college with a sex ratio of almost 1 female for every 10 male students!! While the institute gave so much to me, I sadly never had a true sense of belonging. 
  But it ignited a fire in me to be a role model and mentor the next-gen to increase the representation of women and minorities in STEM.

  While I mostly study brains, I also ocassionaly fly planes, and my love for nature and adventure never wanes :) Outside the lab, 
  you can find me hiking, skiing (I grew up in Chennai, India where we only have three
  seasons - hot, hotter and hottest, so I naturally fell in love with Boston winters!!), rock climbing and doing other things outdoors and adventurous 
  that constantly challenge me to learn something new, overcome my fears, and most importantly 
  help me not get burned out and feel refreshed when I get back to doing science!
