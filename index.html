<p> 
  I am a PhD student at <a href="http://dms.hms.harvard.edu/shbt/">Harvard University</a>
  in the <a href="https://scholar.harvard.edu/polleylab">Polley Lab</a>. 
  Before moving to Boston for graduate school, I was an undergraduate at Indian Institute of Technology, Madras 
  in India where I majored in Electrical Engineering and minored in Biomedical Engineering. 
  While I mostly study brains, I also ocassionaly fly planes and my love for nature and adventure never wanes :)

  For my research so far, I have studied how neural coding of sound transforms along the auditory neuro-axis, 
  the plasticity in the neural coding after hearing loss and sensory guided decision making 
  in challenging environments. I have worked with mice and I've used extracellular electrophysiology to 
  record activity simultaneously from multiple regions in the auditory neuro-axis, as well as 
  calcium imaging to track changes in cell-type specific activity across multiple days. Going forward, I'm broadly interested 
  in studying how our perception of the sensory environment and our decision making changes in different emotional and 
  motivational contexts.
