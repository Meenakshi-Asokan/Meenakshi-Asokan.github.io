    <h4><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04852-y">Sensory overamplification in layer 5 auditory corticofugal projection neurons
        following cochlear nerve synaptic damage

    <p>
        Layer 5 (L5) cortical projection neurons innervate far-ranging brain areas including inferior colliculus (IC), 
        thalamus, lateral amygdala and striatum to coordinate integrative sensory processing 
        and adaptive behaviors. We track daily changes in sound processing 
        using chronic widefield calcium imaging of L5 axon terminals on the dorsal cap of the IC in awake, adult mice. 
        After noise-induced damage of cochlear afferent synapses, the corticocollicular response gain rebounded above baseline levels 
        by the following day and remained elevated for several weeks despite a persistent reduction in auditory nerve input.
        Sustained potentiation of these projection neurons that innervate multiple limbic and subcortical auditory centers may 
        underlie the increased anxiety, stress and other forms of mood dysregulation experienced by subjects who acquire perceptual disorders
        such as tinnitus and hyperacusis after hearing loss. I presented this work as a poster 
        at <a href="{{ site.images }}/sfn_2017_mma_56_42_v3_final.png">SfN 2017</a>, and also received travel awards to present the work as podium talks at 
        <a href="{{ site.images }}/ICACProgram2017.pdf">ICAC 2017</a> and ARO 2018.
