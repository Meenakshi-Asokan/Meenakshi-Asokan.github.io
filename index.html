<p> 
  I am currently a postdoctoral fellow in the <a href="https://tyelab.org/">Tye Lab</a> at <a href="https://www.salk.edu/">Salk Institute</a>. 
  I did my PhD thesis in the <a href="https://scholar.harvard.edu/polleylab">Polley Lab</a> 
  at <a href="http://dms.hms.harvard.edu/shbt/">Harvard University</a>.  
  The overarching goal of my thesis research was to investigate how the neural coding across 
  sensory and limbic hierarchies give rise to the transformation from sensation to perception. To achieve this, 
  I used simultaneous multi-regional single-unit recordings, optogenetics and in-vivo calcium and sensor imaging during head-fixed behavior in awake mice as well as 
  several computational approaches for data analysis. For my postdoctoral work, I'm interested in whether <i>multi-brain</i> coupling predicts and causally drives social engagement and bonding. 
  In the long term, I'm interested in how our emotional state and level of social engagement modulates our perception, and 
  I aim to synthesize the rigor and reductionism in sensory neuroscience with the richness and complexity in naturalistic social behaviors!

  Before moving to Boston for graduate school, I did my undergraduate studies at Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Madras 
  in India where I majored in Electrical Engineering and minored in Biomedical Engineering. I grew up in Chennai, India where we only have three
  seasons - hot, hotter and hottest, so I naturally fell in love with Boston winters!! :D 
  While I mostly study brains, I also ocassionaly fly planes, and my love for nature and adventure never wanes :) Outside the lab, 
  you can find me hiking, skiing, rock climbing and doing other things outdoors and adventurous 
  that constantly challenge me to learn something new, overcome my fears, and most importantly 
  help me not get burned out and feel refreshed when I get back to doing science!
