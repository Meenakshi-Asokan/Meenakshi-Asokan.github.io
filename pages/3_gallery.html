    <p>
        Being in the mountains and becoming one with nature is my go-to therapy to feel happy and refreshed. 
        It all started in my 'home' range, the White Mountains in NH. I've also loved hiking in the National Parks and few other places I've visited.
        <!--including some of the 14ers in CO and Mauna Loa in Big Island of Hawaii (the world's largest volcano eruption of which I witnessed two years later!!)--> 
        <a href="https://meenakshi-asokan.github.io/gallery1/#section_0">Here</a> are more snapshots from my happy place :) </a>

    <p>
        I had never experienced winter or snow the first 20 years of my life, maybe that's why
        I instantaneously fell in love with winter when I moved to Boston. But I probably wouldn't have gotten into winter hiking without <a href = "https://mitoc.mit.edu/">MITOC</a>, 
        their winter school and the community! Some of my favorite <a href="https://meenakshi-asokan.github.io/gallery1/#section_1"> clicks </a> in various winter wonderlands while hiking and skiing.

    </a>
    <p> 
        I started skiing in the winter of 2016, almost a year after I moved to Boston. Since then my love for skiing has only kept growing! It definitely 
        makes me love winter even more! The speed and turns, the challenge and adrenaline rush, the fresh powder and surprise from ever-changing conditions and terrain, 
        the beauty of the surrounding mountains and the feeling of gliding through nature makes it so rewarding and addictive!  More clicks of 
        snow-capped peaks and happy faces shredding the gnar <a href="https://meenakshi-asokan.github.io/gallery1/#section_2"> here</a>! </a>

    <p>
        Check out my amateur shots of some cute birds <a href="https://meenakshi-asokan.github.io/gallery1/#section_3">here</a>. 
        The best thing about birding is that all you need is a pair of binoculars to get started, 
        so most of the photos here are shot on my phone through a 12X binoculars.

        Some photos from my graduation ceremony and thesis defense <a href="https://meenakshi-asokan.github.io/gallery1/#section_4">here</a>. So happy that my parents and partner could be there with me
        for my graduation. This journey would've been impossible without their love, trust and support, even when they were continents away!
