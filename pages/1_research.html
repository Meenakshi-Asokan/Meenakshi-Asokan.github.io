    <h4><a href="{{ site.papers }}/Asokan_et_al_2018_NatComm.pdf">Sensory overamplification in layer 5 auditory corticofugal projection neurons
        following cochlear nerve synaptic damage

        Layer 5 (L5) cortical projection neurons innervate far-ranging brain areas to coordinate integrative sensory processing 
        and adaptive behaviors. Here, we characterize a plasticity in L5 auditory cortex (ACtx) neurons that innervate the 
        inferior colliculus (IC), thalamus, lateral amygdala and striatum. We track daily changes in sound processing 
        using chronic widefield calcium imaging of L5 axon terminals on the dorsal cap of the IC in awake, adult mice. 
        Sound level growth functions at the level of the auditory nerve and corticocollicular axon terminals are both strongly depressed 
        hours after noise-induced damage of cochlear afferent synapses. Corticocollicular response gain rebounded above baseline levels 
        by the following day and remained elevated for several weeks despite a persistent reduction in auditory nerve input.
        Sustained potentiation of excitatory ACtx projection neurons that innervate multiple limbic and subcortical auditory centers may 
        underlie hyperexcitability and aberrant functional coupling of distributed brain networks in tinnitus and hyperacusis.

    <h4><a href="{{ site.papers }}/Asokan_et_al_2020_CurrBio.pdf">Inverted central auditory hierarchies for encoding
local intervals and global temporal patterns

    <p>
        With simultaneous unit recordings from the mouse auditory
        midbrain, thalamus, and cortex, we show an emergent
        sensitivity for slow temporal rhythms at
        the level of the auditory cortex. Whereas
        single units in the mouse midbrain and
        thalamus encode local temporal intervals
        with high fidelity, cortical units integrate
        over extended periods to distinguish
        between random or regular interval
        sequences by adjusting spike timing.

    <h4>Behavioral approaches to reveal top-down influences on active listening
    </a></h4>

        Knowing when to listen can enhance the detection of faint sounds or the
        discrimination of target sounds from distractors. We found that periodicity aided the detectability of a
        liminal repeating target in a complex background noise by increasing the probability of
        late detection events, after the regularity of the target sound had been established. 
        The prolonged time course of repetition-based stream segregation suggests a
        mechanism by which repetitive inputs are integrated over time and used to predict the
        incoming acoustic signal. Our work provides behavioral proof-of-principle for future
        studies to uncover the neural substrates of this prolonged temporal integration process
        in a genetically-tractable model organism.
