<p> 
  I am a PhD student in the <a href="https://scholar.harvard.edu/polleylab">Polley Lab</a> 
  at <a href="http://dms.hms.harvard.edu/shbt/">Harvard University</a>. 
  Before moving to Boston for graduate school, I did my undergraduate studies at Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Madras 
  in India where I majored in Electrical Engineering and minored in Biomedical Engineering. 
  While I mostly study brains, I also ocassionaly fly planes, and my love for nature and adventure never wanes! :)

  For my doctoral thesis, I investigate how the neural coding of sound transforms along the auditory neuro-axis, sensory guided decision making 
  in challenging environments and plasticity in neural circuits after exacerbated sound-triggered anxiety either due to learned fearful associations 
  or due to maladaptive procesess after hearing loss. To this end, I've used anatomical tracing, behavioral approaches, calcium imaging to track 
  changes in cell-type specific activity across multiple days, 
  extracellular electrophysiology to record neural activity simultaneously from multiple regions in awake mice, 
  optogenetics to photo-tag cells and dissect neural circuits, as well as computational techniques for data analysis. 
  My broad interests span the union of sensory perception, 
  motivated and social behaviors, and circuit-level perspectives on why we perceive the world the way we do.
