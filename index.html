<p> 
  I am a PhD student at [Harvard University](http://dms.hms.harvard.edu/shbt/) 
  in the [Polley Lab](https://scholar.harvard.edu/polleylab).
  I am broadly interested in how our perceptions change in different sensory and emotional contexts, 
  and how various circuits in the brain that bring about those changes. 
  Before moving to Boston for graduate school, I was an undergraduate at Indian Institute of Technology, Madras 
  in India where I majored in Electrical Engineering and minored in Biomedical Engineering. 
  While I currently mostly study brains, I also ocassionaly fly planes and my love for nature and adventure never wanes :)

  For my research so far, I have worked with mice and I have used extracellular electrophysiology to 
  simultaneously record activity from multiple regions in the auditory neural axis, 
  calcium imaging of particular cell types to track changes in activity across multiple days, 
  as well as mouse behavior to study sensory perception in challenging environments.
