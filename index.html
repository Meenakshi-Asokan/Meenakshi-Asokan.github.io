<p> 
  I am a PhD student in the <a href="https://scholar.harvard.edu/polleylab">Polley Lab</a> 
  at <a href="http://dms.hms.harvard.edu/shbt/">Harvard University</a>. 
  Before moving to Boston for graduate school, I did my undergraduate studies at Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Madras 
  in India where I majored in Electrical Engineering and minored in Biomedical Engineering. 
  While I mostly study brains, I also ocassionaly fly planes, and my love for nature and adventure never wanes! :)

  For my doctoral thesis, I investigate how the neural coding of sound transforms along the auditory neuro-axis, 
  the plasticity in the neural coding after hearing loss, sensory guided decision making 
  in challenging environments and functional interactions between the auditory cortex and limbic system as sounds acquire an emotional meaning. 
  To this end, I've used anatomical tracing, calcium imaging to track changes in cell-type specific activity across multiple days, 
  extracellular electrophysiology to record neural activity simultaneously from multiple regions in awake mice, 
  optogenetics to photo-tag cells and dissect neural circuits,
  behavioral approaches, and computational techniques for data analysis. My broad interests span the union of sensory perception, 
  motivated and social behaviors, and circuit-level perspectives on why we perceive the world the way we do.
