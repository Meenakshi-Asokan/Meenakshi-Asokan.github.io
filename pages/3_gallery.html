    <p>
        Being in the mountains and becoming one with nature is definitely the therapy that works best for me. 
        It all started in my 'home' range, the White Mountains in NH. I've also loved hiking in the National Parks and few other places I've visited 
        including some of the 14ers in CO and Mauna Loa in Big Island of Hawaii (the world's largest volcano which I saw erupt two years later!!). 
        There are many many more hikes in my bucketlist, but hitting literally any trail close to where I live is my go-to therapy to feel happy and refreshed! 
        <a href="https://meenakshi-asokan.github.io/gallery1/#section_0">Here</a> are more snapshots from my happy place :) </a>

    </a></h4>
    </a>
    <p>
        I grew up in Chennai where we only know hot, hotter and hottest and I hated that. Maybe that's why
        I instantaneously fell in love with winter when I moved to Boston. But I probably would'nt have really gotten into winter hiking without <a href = "https://mitoc.mit.edu/">MITOC</a>
        ,their winter school and the community! Now I absolutely love winter hiking, even though it means more preparation and effort, more precautions and more stuff to carry - extra layers, 
        microspikes and sometimes crampons, snow shoes and ice axe. But I find it totally worth it and everything is so much more beautiful when covered in snow! 
        Some of my favorite clicks during my winter hikes <a href="https://meenakshi-asokan.github.io/gallery1/#section_1">here</a>.</a>

    <p>
        More clicks of snow-capped peaks and happy faces shredding the gnar <a href="https://meenakshi-asokan.github.io/gallery1/#section_2"> here</a>! I 
        started skiing in the winter of 2016, almost a year after I moved to Boston. Since then my love for skiing has only kept growing! It definitely 
        makes me love winter even more! The speed and turns, the challenge and adrenaline rush, the fresh powder and surprise from ever-changing conditions and terrain, 
        the beauty of the surrounding mountains and the feeling of gliding through nature makes it so rewarding and addictive! </a>

    <p>
        Check out my amateur shots of some cute birds <a href="https://meenakshi-asokan.github.io/gallery1/#section_3">here</a>. 
        The best thing about birding is that all you need is a pair of binoculars to get started and that's all I invested in, 
        so all the photos are shot on my phone through a 12X binoculars.
        But some extra love for the birds will make up for the lack of a fancy camera :) I find bird watching a super relaxing 
        hobby that lets me connect with nature and come back with so much appreciation for the beauty of birds - their colors, songs, flight and so much more!
