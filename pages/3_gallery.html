        Check out my amateur shots of some cute birds <a href="https://meenakshi-asokan.github.io/gallery2/"> here. 
        I only possess a pair of binoculars, so most of my photos are shot on my phone through a 12X binoculars.
        But I believe the extra love for birds will make up for the lack of a fancy camera! Bird watching is one of those super relaxing 
        hobbies that lets you connect with nature and come back with so much appreciation for the beauty of birds - their colors, songs, flight and so much more!
