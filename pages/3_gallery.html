        More shots of snow-capped peaks and happy faces shredding the gnar <a href="https://meenakshi-asokan.github.io/gallery1/#section_0"> here </a>! I 
        started skiing in the winter of 2016, almost a year after I moved to Boston. Since then my love for skiing has only kept growing! It definitely 
        makes me love winter even more! The speed, the turns, the challenge, the adrenaline rush, the fresh powder, the surprise from the ever-changing conditions and terrain, 
        the beauty of the surrounding mountains and the feeling of gliding through nature makes it all worth it :) </a>.

        Check out my amateur shots of some cute birds <a href="https://meenakshi-asokan.github.io/gallery1/#section_0"> here </a>. 
        The best thing about birding is that all you need is a pair of binoculars to get started and that's all I invested in, 
        so all the photos are shot on my phone through a 12X binoculars.
        But some extra love for the birds will make up for the lack of a fancy camera :) I find bird watching a super relaxing 
        hobby that lets me connect with nature and come back with so much appreciation for the beauty of birds - their colors, songs, flight and so much more!
