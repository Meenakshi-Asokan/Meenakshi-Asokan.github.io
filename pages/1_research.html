    <h4><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04852-y">Sensory overamplification in layer 5 auditory corticofugal projection neurons
        following cochlear nerve synaptic damage
    </a></h4>

    <p>
        Layer 5 (L5) cortical projection neurons innervate far-ranging brain areas including inferior colliculus (IC), 
        thalamus, lateral amygdala and striatum to coordinate integrative sensory processing 
        and adaptive behaviors. We track daily changes in sound processing 
        using chronic widefield calcium imaging of L5 axon terminals on the dorsal cap of the IC in awake, adult mice. 
        After noise-induced damage of cochlear afferent synapses, the corticocollicular response gain rebounded above baseline levels 
        by the following day and remained elevated for several weeks despite a persistent reduction in auditory nerve input.
        Sustained potentiation of these projection neurons that innervate multiple limbic and subcortical auditory centers may 
        underlie the increased anxiety, stress and other forms of mood dysregulation experienced by subjects who acquire perceptual disorders
        such as tinnitus and hyperacusis after hearing loss. I presented this work as a poster 
        at <a href="{{ site.images }}/sfn_2017_mma_56_42_v3_final.png">SfN 2017</a>, and also received travel awards to present the work as podium talks at ICAC 2017 and ARO 2018.

    <h4><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096098222100141X?dgcid=author">Inverted central auditory hierarchies for encoding
local intervals and global temporal patterns

        With simultaneous unit recordings from the mouse auditory
        midbrain, thalamus, and cortex, we look at transformation of neural coding along the 
        auditory neuro-axis and we find inverted hierarchies in neural coding of sensory features
        with different temporal scales. We observed that the decay constants for sound-evoked spiking
        increased from the midbrain to cortex, and that the cortical timescale
        was itself shaped by slower changes in stimulus context,
        such that rhythmic, predictable sequences featured more
        orderly first spike latencies and more strongly dampened spiking
        decay. These findings show that low-level auditory neurons with fast timescales encode isolated
        sound features but not the longer gestalt, while the extended timescales in higher-level areas can facilitate
        sensitivity to slower contextual changes in the sensory environment. I presented this work in a number of conferences 
        including <a href="{{ site.images }}/shbt_midwinterforum_2020_final_pdf_mma.png">NCCD 2019</a>, 
        <a href="{{ site.images }}/cosyne_2020_v4_withtext_final.png">Cosyne 2020</a>, and <a href="https://www.crowdcast.io/e/apan-2020/4">APAN 2020</a>
        where I was awarded for one of the

    <p>
        Knowing when to listen can enhance the detection of faint sounds or the
        discrimination of target sounds from distractors. We found that periodicity aided the detectability of a
        liminal repeating target in a complex background noise by increasing the probability of
        late detection events, after the regularity of the target sound had been established. 
        The prolonged time course of repetition-based stream segregation suggests a
        mechanism by which repetitive inputs are integrated over time and used to predict the
        incoming acoustic signal. Our work provides behavioral proof-of-principle for future
        studies to uncover the neural substrates of this prolonged temporal integration process
        in a genetically-tractable model organism.

    <h4>Functional contributions of the circuits between auditory cortex and amygdala for affective sound processing
    </h4>
    <h5>Asokan, M.M., Watanabe, Y., and Polley, D.B., Work in Progress...</h5>
    </a>
    <p>
       Sounds in our environment that are not innately aversive can also trigger exacerbated distress
        as a result of being associated with aversive events, or due to maladaptive plasticity after damage to the auditory system in cases such as hyperacusis. 
        While classical work has focused on Basolateral Amygdala (BLA) as a central structure in fear learning 
        and a hub that facilitates integration of information, recent works argue for a role of auditory cortex (ACtx) 
        that goes beyond mere routing of sounds, and the functional interactions between the two regions 
        that have a rich reciprocal connectivity is not fully understood. 
        Here, we use anatomical tracing, fear conditioning, orofacial videography, simultaneous single-unit and field potential recordings from 
        ACtx and BLA, as well as optogenetic tagging of cortico-amygdala projectors to elucidate the contribution of the long-range circuits between ACtx and BLA
        to sound-triggered anxiety.
