        following cochlear nerve synaptic damage

        Layer 5 (L5) cortical projection neurons innervate far-ranging brain areas including inferior colliculus (IC), 
        thalamus, lateral amygdala and striatum to coordinate integrative sensory processing 
        and adaptive behaviors. We track daily changes in sound processing 
        using chronic widefield calcium imaging of L5 axon terminals on the dorsal cap of the IC in awake, adult mice. 
        After noise-induced damage of cochlear afferent synapses, the corticocollicular response gain rebounded above baseline levels 
        by the following day and remained elevated for several weeks despite a persistent reduction in auditory nerve input.
        Sustained potentiation of these projection neurons that innervate multiple limbic and subcortical auditory centers may 
        underlie the increased anxiety, stress and other forms of mood dysregulation experienced by subjects who acquire perceptual disorders
        such as tinnitus and hyperacusis after hearing loss.

    <h4><a href="{{ site.papers }}/Asokan_et_al_2020_CurrBio.pdf">Inverted central auditory hierarchies for encoding
local intervals and global temporal patterns
    </a></h4>

        With simultaneous unit recordings from the mouse auditory
        midbrain, thalamus, and cortex, we look at transformation of neural coding along the 
        auditory neuro-axis and we find inverted hierarchies in neural coding of sensory features
        with different temporal scales. We observed that the decay constants for sound-evoked spiking
        increased from the midbrain to cortex, and that the cortical timescale
        was itself shaped by slower changes in stimulus context,
        such that rhythmic, predictable sequences featured more
        orderly first spike latencies and more strongly dampened spiking
        decay. These findings show that low-level auditory neurons with fast timescales encode isolated
        sound features but not the longer gestalt, while the extended timescales in higher-level areas can facilitate
        sensitivity to slower contextual changes in the sensory environment.

        Knowing when to listen can enhance the detection of faint sounds or the
        discrimination of target sounds from distractors. We found that periodicity aided the detectability of a
        liminal repeating target in a complex background noise by increasing the probability of
        late detection events, after the regularity of the target sound had been established. 
        The prolonged time course of repetition-based stream segregation suggests a
        mechanism by which repetitive inputs are integrated over time and used to predict the
        incoming acoustic signal. Our work provides behavioral proof-of-principle for future
        studies to uncover the neural substrates of this prolonged temporal integration process
        in a genetically-tractable model organism.
