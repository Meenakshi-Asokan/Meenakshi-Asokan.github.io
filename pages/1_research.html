    <h4><a href="{{ site.papers }}/Asokan_et_al_2018_NatComm.pdf">Sensory overamplification in layer 5 auditory corticofugal projection neurons
        following cochlear nerve synaptic damage
    </a></h4>

        Layer 5 (L5) cortical projection neurons innervate far-ranging brain areas including inferior colliculus (IC), 
        thalamus, lateral amygdala and striatum to coordinate integrative sensory processing 
        and adaptive behaviors. We track daily changes in sound processing 
        using chronic widefield calcium imaging of L5 axon terminals on the dorsal cap of the IC in awake, adult mice. 
        After noise-induced damage of cochlear afferent synapses, the corticocollicular response gain rebounded above baseline levels 
        by the following day and remained elevated for several weeks despite a persistent reduction in auditory nerve input.
        Sustained potentiation of these projection neurons that innervate multiple limbic and subcortical auditory centers may 
        underlie the increased anxiety, stress and other forms of mood dysregulation experienced by subjects who acquire perceptual disorders
        such as tinnitus and hyperacusis after hearing loss.

local intervals and global temporal patterns

    <p>
        With simultaneous unit recordings from the mouse auditory
        midbrain, thalamus, and cortex, we show an emergent
        sensitivity for slow temporal rhythms at
        the level of the auditory cortex. Whereas
        single units in the mouse midbrain and
        thalamus encode local temporal intervals
        with high fidelity, cortical units integrate
        over extended periods to distinguish
        between random or regular interval
        sequences by adjusting spike timing.

    <h4>Behavioral approaches to reveal top-down influences on active listening
    </a></h4>

        Knowing when to listen can enhance the detection of faint sounds or the
        discrimination of target sounds from distractors. We found that periodicity aided the detectability of a
        liminal repeating target in a complex background noise by increasing the probability of
        late detection events, after the regularity of the target sound had been established. 
        The prolonged time course of repetition-based stream segregation suggests a
        mechanism by which repetitive inputs are integrated over time and used to predict the
        incoming acoustic signal. Our work provides behavioral proof-of-principle for future
        studies to uncover the neural substrates of this prolonged temporal integration process
        in a genetically-tractable model organism.
