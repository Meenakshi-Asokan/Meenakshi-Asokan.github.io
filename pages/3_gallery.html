        Check out my amateur shots of some cute birds <a href="https://meenakshi-asokan.github.io/gallery1/#section_0"> here </a>. 
        The best thing about birding is that all you need is a pair of binoculars to get started and that's all I invested in, 
        so all the photos are shot on my phone through a 12X binoculars.
        But some extra love for the birds will make up for the lack of a fancy camera :) I find bird watching a super relaxing 
        hobby that lets me connect with nature and come back with so much appreciation for the beauty of birds - their colors, songs, flight and so much more!
